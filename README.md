# Backend Assessment

Build an uptime monitoring RESTful API server that allows authenticated users to monitor URLs, and get detailed uptime reports about their availability, average response time, and total uptime/downtime.

## Overview

- Signup with email verification. ✔️
- CRUD operations for URL checks (`GET`, `PUT` and `DELETE` can be called only by the user user who created the check).✔️
- Authenticated users can receive a notification whenever one of their URLs goes down or up again:
  - Email.✔️
  - Webhook _(optional)_.✔️
- Authenticated users can get detailed uptime reports about their URLs availability, average response time, and total uptime/downtime.✔️
- Authenticated users can group their checks by tags and get reports by tag.✔️

## Acceptance Criteria

- APIs should be consuming and producing `application/json`.✔️
- Authenication should be stateless.✔️
- Each URL check may have the following options:
  - `name`: The name of the check.✔️
  - `url`: The URL to be monitored.✔️
  - `protocol`: The resource protocol name `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, or `TCP`.✔️
  - `path`: A specific path to be monitored _(optional)_.✔️
  - `port`: The server port number _(optional)_.✔️
  - `webhook`: A webhook URL to receive a notification on _(optional)_.✔️
  - `timeout` _(defaults to 5 seconds)_: The timeout of the polling request _(optional)_.✔️
  - `interval` _(defaults to 10 minutes)_: The time interval for polling requests _(optional)_.✔️
  - `threshold` _(defaults to 1 failure)_: The threshold of failed requests that will create an alert _(optional)_.✔️
  - `authentication`: An HTTP authentication header, with the Basic scheme, to be sent with the polling request _(optional)_.✔️
    - `authentication.username`
    - `authentication.password`
  - `httpHeaders`: A list of key/value pairs custom HTTP headers to be sent with the polling request (optional).✔️
  - `assert`: The response assertion to be used on the polling response (optional).
    - `assert.statusCode`: An HTTP status code to be asserted.
  - `tags`: A list of the check tags (optional).✔️
  - `ignoreSSL`: A flag to ignore broken/expired SSL certificates in case of using the HTTPS protocol.✔️
- Each report may have the following information:✔️
  - `status`: The current status of the URL.✔️
  - `availability`: A percentage of the URL availability.✔️
  - `outages`: The total number of URL downtimes.✔️
  - `downtime`: The total time, in seconds, of the URL downtime.✔️
  - `uptime`: The total time, in seconds, of the URL ✔️uptime.
  - `responseTime`: The average response time for the URL.✔️
  - `history`: Timestamped logs of the polling requests.✔️

## Evaluation Criteria

- Code quality.
- Code scalability as we should be able to add a new alerting notification channel like Slack, Firebase, SMS, etc.. with the minimum possible changes.✔️
- Unit tests.

## Bonus

- API documentation.✔️
- Docker and Docker Compose.
- [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) integration to receive alerts on mobile devices.✔️

Try your best to implement as much as you can from the given requirements and feel free to add more if you want to.
