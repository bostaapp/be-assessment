#### Given more time, the following could have been implemented/enhanced:

- Implementing the application in clean code architecture.
- Schedule another cron job to send reports to users' email/webhoook address.
- Set up swagger for those endpoints.
- Make an endpoint to remove/clear listeners to avoid leaking listeners in case certain listeners are not needed anymore.
- Add unit tests & Integration tests
